# Configuration Section
#

# There are three variables that can be changed to control how
# fmtcat works.  They are:
#
# cap_flag
# spacer
# home_text
#
# Each is described in detail below.  The default values are
# all valid so you don't even have to do anything, if you don't
# mind your categories looking the way mine do.

#

# cap_flag controls whether or not each level of the category
# tree is to be capitalized.  If set to "Y", then the first
# letter of each category level will be capitalized.  For example,
#
# food/dinner/meat
#
# would become
#
# Food/Dinner/Meat
#
# If you don't want capitalization, (You know who you are, e. e.)
# set this flag to "N" (or, actually, any value other than "Y").

$cap_flag       = "Y";

# spacer is the text that will separate each level of the
# category tree.  Possible spacers include:
#
#    Spacer     Description     Sample
#    ------     --------------  ---------------------------
#    " > "      Yahoo Style     Food > Dinner > Meat
#    " :: "     Arts & Crafts   Food :: Dinner :: Meat
#    " | "      Unix Geek       Food | Dinner | Meat
#    ", "       Librarian       Food, Dinner, Meat
#
# Feel free to make up your own, of course.

$spacer         = " :: ";

# home_text is used to add a top level category to the category
# tree.  If you don't want one, uncomment the first definition
# by removing the number sign (#) at the start of the line and
# adding one at the start of the second definition (the line
# where it is given the value "Home" by default.
#
# Examples:
#
# Given a hierarchy of:
#
#       /Food
#       /Food/Dinner/
#       /Food/Dinner/Meat
#       /Food/Dinner/Veg
#       /Drink
#       /Drink/Coffee
#       /Drink/Coffee/Sumatra
#
# With a home_text of "Home", and a spacer of " > ", these would be
# displayed as follows:
#
#       Home > Food
#       Home > Food > Dinner
#       Home > Food > Dinner > Meat
#       Home > Food > Dinner > Veg
#       Home > Drink
#       Home > Drink > Coffee
#       Home > Drink > Coffee > Sumatra
#
# With no home_text defined and the same spacer, the categories
# would look like this:
#
#       Food
#       Food > Dinner
#       Food > Dinner > Meat
#       Food > Dinner > Veg
#       Drink
#       Drink > Coffee
#       Drink > Coffee > Sumatra
#
# It's your choice as to what you prefer.

# Remove the number sign from this line to disable the home category
#$home_text;

# Put your text in this variable (and leave the previous line alone)
# if you want a top level category added.
$home_text      = "Home";
