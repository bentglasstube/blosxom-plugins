Name
    Amputator 1.2 for Movable Type and Blosxom

Synopsis
     <$MTEntryBody encode_ampersands="1"$>

Short Description
    Amputator is a free plugin for Movable Type and Blosxom. It safely
    rewrites ampersand characters as an HTML entity reference: "&amp;".

Long Description
    If you want your HTML or XHTML to display smoothly across browsers and
    platforms, you need to use a little finesse with non-ASCII characters
    such as curly quotes, or "Š", or "ª." On the web, I would have specified
    those last two characters by writing "&#xe4;" and "&#8482;."

    Sequences like "&#8482;" are called entity references, and their sole
    benefit is that they can be expressed in plain ASCII. HTML includes
    heaps of entity references to stand in for various accented and
    otherwise special characters not found in ASCII. Entity references all
    start with ampersands, and end with semicolons.

    Unfortunately, X/HTML reserves the ampersand exclusively for entity
    references. Any time you use an ampersand by itself in HTML, for
    example, within the token delimiters of GET-style URLs, the parser will
    interpret it like the start of a nonexistent entity reference. Any
    decent browser will catch the error and recover, but it's still a
    mistake, and your HTML won't validate.

    You can make your HTML clean again by replacing any ampersands with the
    entity reference for an ampersand. So instead of just "&", you'd write
    "&amp;", and the browser will make the last-minute substitution.

    Amputator steps in to relieve you of the crushing, trivial burden of
    replacing all those ampersands yourself. After installation into Movable
    Type or Blosxom, you can freely gab about Law & Order and Brown &
    Williamson, and your ampersands will be replaced by entity references on
    the fly, as you publish.

    Of course, Amputator is smart enough to ignore ampersands attached to
    existing entities. Otherwise, writing "&eacute;" would become
    "&amp;eacute;", and nobody likes that except the odd technical writer.

Movable Type Installation
    Amputator requires Movable Type version 2.5 or later, and works fine
    with MT 3.x.

    1.
        Copy the Amputator.pl file into your Movable Type plugins directory.
        If you don't have a plugins directory, create an empty directory
        named "plugins" in your MT server root, alongside all the MT CGIs,
        and put Amputator inside that new directory. In other words, your
        installation should look like this:

          (MT home)/plugins/Amputator.pl

        If you're using the MT "dynamic publishing" model, you'll want to
        install the PHP version of the Amputator plugin. Copy the
        "modifier.encode_ampersands.php" file from the "optional" folder of
        the Amputator distribution into MT's PHP plugins folder:

          (MT home)/php/plugins/modifier.encode_ampersands.php

        You can skip this step if you're not using dynamic publishing, but
        there's no harm installing it.

    2.  Now it's time to edit your blog templates. Any tags that might
        contain a stray ampersand should be modified to call
        encode_ampersands. MTEntryBody is an obvious place to start:

          <$MTEntryBody$>

        becomes

          <$MTEntryBody encode_ampersands="1"$>

        Easy! Ditto for MTEntryMore, or MTEntryTitle:

          <$MTEntryMore encode_ampersands="1"$>
          <$MTEntryTitle encode_ampersands="1"$>

        You're done.

Blosxom Installation
    Amputator requires Blosxom version 2.0 or later.

    1.  Rename the plugin from "Amputator.pl" to "Amputator". (Movable Type
        requires the dot-pl suffix for its plugins, but Blosxom forbids it.)

    2.  Copy the Amputator file into your Blosxom plugins directory. You're
        done. Amputator will cover the title and body of all entries.

Bugs
    I know of only one case where Amputator improperly replaces an
    ampersand: if you're using a JavaScript snippet inside of a weblog
    entry, Amputator may convert an ampersand intended for the JavaScript
    interpreter instead of the browser, confusing the interpreter. If this
    problem affects you, please let me know at the address below so we can
    discuss a solution.

    Aside from that, if you encounter a problem, please send me a note and
    tell me all about it.

Version History
    *   1.2 Friday, August 26, 2005

        Now compatible with Movable Type 3.2, as well as earlier versions.

        Blosxom already encodes ampersands when producing RSS, so Amputator
        leaves Blosxom's RSS output alone. I also abandoned the cleaner
        MT::Plugin namespace, because Blosxom couldn't handle it.

        Amputator now officially supports MT's dynamic publishing model
        (thanks, Chad Everett).

    *   1.1.1 Mon, Feb 21, 2005

        No functional code changes, but Amputator now declares itself to MT
        3 installations on the main menu page, and uses the sanctioned
        MT::Plugin::Amputator package instead of the Amputator package.
        Existing users should feel no pressure to upgrade unless they enjoy
        looking at the plugin census.

        Also uses the MT::Plugin::Amputator package, instead of just
        Amputator.

    *   1.1 Tue, March 16, 2004

        Updated for Blosxom support.

    *   1.0: Thu, March 6, 2003

        Initial release.

        Documentation revised September 28, 2003.

Additional Credits
    John Gruber (http://daringfireball.net) precipitated the release of this
    plugin by providing several good reasons why he was unwilling to make
    SmartyPants take care if it for me.

    Max Barry (http://maxbarry.com), whose novel "Jennifer Government" I
    quite enjoyed, suggested adding Blosxom support, and proposed the
    mechanism to exclude ampersand encoding from RSS output (when Blosxom
    handles the encoding by itself).
