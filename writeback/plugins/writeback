=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: writeback

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides WriteBacks, a combination of comments and TrackBacks 
[http://www.movabletype.org/trackback/].

All comments and TrackBack pings for a particular story are kept in
$writeback_dir/$path/$filename.cmt.

=head2 QUICK START

Drop this writeback plug-in file into your plug-ins directory 
(whatever you set as $plugin_dir in blosxom.cgi).

Writeback, being a well-behaved plug-in, won't do anything until you set 
$writeback_dir.

While you can use the same directory as your blosxom $datadir (WriteBacks
are saved as path/weblog_entry_name.wb), it's probably better to keep
them separate.

Once set, the next time you visit your site, the writeback plug-in will
perform some checks, creating the $writeback_dir and setting appropriate
permissions if it doesn't already exist.  (Check your error_log for details
of what's happening behind the scenes.)

Move the contents of the flavours folder included in this distribution 
into your Blosxom data directory (whatever you set as $datadir in blosxom.cgi).
Don't move the folder itself, only the files it contains!  If you don't
have the the sample flavours handy, you can download them from:

http://www.raelity.org/apps/blosxom/downloads/plugins/writeback.zip

Point your browser at one of your Blosxom entries, specifying the writeback 
flavour (e.g. http://localhost/cgi-bin/blosxom.cgi/path/to/a/post.writeback)

Enjoy!

=back

=head2 FLAVOUR TEMPLATE VARIABLES

Wherever you wish all the WriteBacks for a particular story to appear
in your flavour templates, use $writeback::writebacks.

A count of WriteBacks for each story may be embedded in your flavour
templates with $writeback::count.

If you'd like, you can embed a "Thanks for the writeback." or 
"There was a problem posting your writeback." message after posting with
$writeback::writeback_response.

=head2 SAMPLE FLAVOUR TEMPLATES

I've made sample flavour templates available to you to help with any
learning curve this plug-in might require.

Take a gander at the source HTML/XML for:

=item * story.writeback, a basic example of a single-entry story
flavour with WriteBacks embedded.  You should not use this as your
default flavour since every story on the home page would have WriteBacks
right there with the story itself.

=item * foot.writeback provides a simple comment form for posting to the
WriteBack plug-in.  NOTE: The writeback plug-in requires the presence
of a "plugin" form variable with the value set to "writeback"; this tells
the plug-in that it should handle the incoming POSTing data rather than
leaving it for another plug-in.

=item * writeback.writeback is a sample flavour file for WriteBacks themselves. 
Think of a WriteBacks flavour file as a story flavour file for individual 
WriteBacks.

=back

=head2 FLAVOURING WRITEBACKS

While the default does a pretty good job, you can flavour your WriteBacks
in the writeback flavour file (e.g. writeback.writeback) using the following 
variables:

=item * $writeback::name$writeback::blog_name - Name entered in comment form or weblog name used in TrackBack ping.

=item * $writeback::url - URL entered in comment form or that of writing citing your weblog entry via TrackBack ping.

=item * $writeback::title - Title entered into comment form or that of writing citing your weblog entry via TrackBack ping.

=item * $writeback::comment$writeback::excerpt - Comment entered into comment aorm or excerpt of writing citing your weblog entry via TrackBack ping.

=item * $writeback::pref_name and $writeback::pref_url are prepopulated with the values of the form you just submitted or preferences stored in a 'writeback' cookie, if you've the cookie plug-in installed an enabled.

=back

=head2 INVITING AND SUPPORTING TRACKBACKS

You should provide the TrackBack ping URL for each story so that those
wanting to TrackBack ping you manually know where to ping.  
$writeback::trackback_path_and_filename, together with $url and 
a TrackBack flavour will provide them all they need.

e.g. $url$writeback::trackback_path_and_filename.trackback

The writeback plugin provides an XML response to TrackBack pings in the form
of a baked-in trackback flavour.  If you alter the value of $trackback_flavour
(why would you?), you'll have to create a set of flavour templates by hand; all 
should be blank save the content_type (text/xml) and head ($writeback::trackback_response).

=head1 INSTALLATION

Drop writeback into your plug-ins directory ($blosxom::plugin_dir).

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 (REQUIRED) SPECIFYING A WRITEBACK DIRECTORY

Writeback, being a well-behaved plug-in, won't do anything until you set 
$writeback_dir, create the directory, and make it write-able by Blosxom.

Create a directory to save WriteBacks to (e.g. $plugin_state_dir/writeback),
and set $writeback_dir to the path to that directory.

While you can use the same directory as your blosxom $datadir (WriteBacks
are saved as path/weblog_entry_name.wb), it's probably better to keep
them separate.

The writeback plug-in will create the appropriate paths to mimick your
$datadir hierarchy on-the-fly.  So, for a weblog entry in 
$datadir/some/path/or/other/entry.txt, WriteBacks will be kept in
$writeback_dir/some/path/or/other/entry.wb.

=head2 (OPTIONAL) ALTERING THE TRACKBACK FLAVOUR

The $trackback_flavour sets the flavour the plug-in associates with incoming TrackBack pings.  Unless this corresponds to the flavour associated with your trackback URL, the writeback plug-in will ignore incoming pings.

=head2 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFYING AN EXTENSION FOR WRITEBACK FILES

The default extension for WriteBacks is wb.  You can change this if
you wish by altering the $file_extension value.

=head2 (OPTIONAL) SPECIFYING WHAT FIELDS YOU EXPECT IN YOUR COMMENTS FORM

The defaults are probably ok here, but you can specify that the writeback
plug-in should look for more fields in your comments form by adding to this
list.  You should keep at least the defaults in place so as not to break
anything.
