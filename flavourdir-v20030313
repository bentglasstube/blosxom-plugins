=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: flavourdir

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Keep your flavours in a separate flavour directory rather than alongside all of your weblog entries.  Optionally falls back to the default of looking in your Blosxom datadir.

Overrides Blosxom's default template() subroutine.

Respects the Blosxom concept of finding flavours along specific paths, expecting to find these paths echoed in your flavour directory.

=head1 INSTALLATION AND CONFIGURATION

Drop the flavourdir plug-in into your Blosxom plugins folder.

The plug-in is preconfigured to assume a flavour directory beneath your Blosxom data directory.  Alter the $flavour_dir configurable variable to move it elsewhere.

If you'd like the plug-in to fall back to looking in your Blosxom data directory if it doesn't find the appropriate flavour in your flavour directory, set the $fallback_to_datadir configurable variable to 1.  Note: This results in additional processing and isn't a particularly efficient use of a plug-in's time.
