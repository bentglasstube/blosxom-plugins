=head1 NAME

Blosxom Plug-in: static_file

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Cause Blosxom to see if the URL requested actually exists on the filesystem.  If it does, then return the file, and then exit the script allowing for binary file serves.  If the file does not exist, then the Bloxsom script will continue noting whether it needs to do a flavour translation on the data file, etc.

This allows you to integrate existing webpages to a Blosxom site.

Another convinience of this is that when you wish to include an image or anything besides just the blog entry, you can place the file in the same directory as your text file, and reference it with a $url$path (supposing you are using interpolate_conditional or interpolate_fancy).

=head1 VERSION

2004-02-13

Version number is the date on which this version of the plug-in was created.

=head1 AUTHOR

Original idea by Raffi Krikorian <r@bitwaste.com>, http://www.bitwaste.com/, author of the binary plugin.

=head1 NOTES

If you are using this plugin in Blosxom's dynamic mode, you might consider creating a custom B<error> flavour, because Blosxom's default B<error> flavour could be confusing for the user.

It is recommanded, for performance optimization, to put a number in front of the name of this plugin, for instance to name it B<00static_file>, so that it loads among the first.
