=head1 Name

Blosxom Plug-In: storystate

=head1 Synopsis

Provides a number of convenience variables for use with the 
interpolate_fancy plugin by Blosxom author Rael Dornfest.
Especially useful with writeback.  Allows presence of a 
meta-writeback tag to control if writebacks are open or closed.
Basically useless without interpolate_fancy.

NOTE:  best if used with interpolate_fancy version 2003-09-07 or later.

=head2 Quick Start

Just drop it in your $plugin_dir.  Optionally, you can adjust the values
of the configuration variables at the top of the file.  There are covered later.

Most of the variables are simple boolean indicators, using undef for false.  
This allows them to be used with interpolate_fancy's <?$var></?> and 
<?!$var></?> constructs.  Some variables are story specific, (updated for 
each story), while others are based on the request url and are valid in the
head and foot as well.

The request flag variables are:

$permalink	true if request url is a subdir permalink, e.g. /this/that/story.html
$datepermalink	true if request url is a date permalink, e.g. /2003/09/07/story.html
$anypermalink   true if request url is either of above
$blogroot	true if request is for blog's root e.g. / or /index.html
$archive	true if request if date style, e.g. /2003/09
$category	true if request is subdir style, e.g. /this/that

There is request-level text variable:

$rqst_category  the category in the request.  Similar to $blosxom::path, but
                available in the head.  Mixed mode (category+date) request
                are ok, only returns category.

The story-specific flag variables are:

$writeback_closed	true if writebacks are closed for story (see below)
$permalink_wbopen	true if !$writeback_closed and $permalink
$permalink_wbclosed	true if $writeback_closed and $permalink

The idea of closing writebacks is that you are no longer accepting comments for a 
given story.  Just add meta-writeback: on or meta-writeback: off to the header of 
the story.  If no meta-writeback header is found, the value of the config variable 
$writeback_default is used instead.  Values are on (writebacks open) and off 
(writebacks closed).  This is of course dependant upon you implementing checks 
against these variables in our story template, see the example below.

There is also a story-specific text variable:

$writeback_message	description of writeback state for story

This is useful for links to your writeback page.  It returns (by default):

'Add the first comment'	If writebacks are open for story and no comments exist
'No Comments'		if writebacks are close and no comments exist
'1 comment'		if only one comment
'n comments'		if >1 comment, n=$writeback::count

These messages are configurable, see the config variables at the top of the file,
they are documented inline.	    

=head1 Example

To put 'smart' writebacks into your story template (only show when
viewing a permalink; obey open/closed writeback state) you could do this:

<!-- only show Writebacks if viewing a single story (permalink) -->
<?$storystate::Permalink>
<H3>Writebacks...</H3>

<!-- response if comment just posted -->
<P Id="Response"><$writeback::Writeback_Response /></P>

<!-- insert Writebacks For This Story -->

<$writeback::Writebacks />
</?>

<!-- show comment entry form & trackback url only if viewing a 
     permalink AND writebacks are open -->
<?$storystate::Permalink_Wbopen>

<H3>Comment On This Entry</H3>

<!-- The Right Url For A Trackback Ping; Notice The Flavour Is Trackback -->

<Div Class="Input">
<H4>Trackbacks</H4>
<P>Trackback Ping Me At:</P>
<P><$url /><$writeback::Trackback_Path_And_Filename />.Trackback</P>
</Div>
<Div Class="Input">
  <H4>Comments</H4>

<!-- A Simple Comments Form -->

<Form Method="Post" Action="<$url />/<$path_Info />">
  <P>Name:<Input Name="Name"  Value="<$writeback::Pref_Name />" Class="Text" /></P>
  <P>Url/Email:<Input Name="Url"  Value="<$writeback::Pref_Url />" Class="Text" /><Br />
  <Span Class="Hint">[Http://... Or Mailto:You@Wherever] (Optional)</Span></P>
  <P>Title:<Input Name="Title" Class="Text"  /><Br />
  <Span Class="Hint">(Optional)</Span></P>
  <P>Comments:<Textarea Name="Comment" Rows="5"></Textarea></P>
  <P><Input Class="Checkbox" Type="Checkbox" Name="Save_Preferences" Value="1" Checked /> Save My Name And Url/Email For Next Time</P>
  <Input Type="Hidden" Name="Plugin" Value="Writeback" />
  <Input Type="Submit" Value="Post" />
</Form>
</?>

<!-- If comments are closed (and this is a permalink) inform the user -->
<?$storystate::Permalink_Wbclosed><H4>Comments Have Been Closed For This Entry.  Thank You For Your Interest.</H4></?>


A note or two:  This example comes from my primary story template.  
It may differ from the story.writeback flavour bit that comes with 
writebacks in a few ways; extra divs & classes, and no table for 
the form.  My site is uses alot of CSS for formatting, you can use the
table based layout if you prefer.

=head1 Bugs

Maybe not a bug, but does not follow normal Blosxom plugin convention of
package name matching plugin name.  Package name is 'sh' for brevity; plugin
name is 'shorthand' for clarity.
