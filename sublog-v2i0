# -*- perl -*-
# Blosxom Plugin: sublog
# Author: Terrence Yu (but most of the hard work was done by Brian St. Pierre and infozo)
# Version: 2.0
# License: caveat emptor
# Purpose: to allow links of interest to be shown on a blosxom weblog, using blosxom itself to
# create archives and RSS feeds.

# Each sublog entry should contain:
# Line 1: title
# Line 2: url of interesting link
# Line 3 onwards: optional commentary
#
# Variables of use
# $sublog::sublog = variable that outputs the links in an unordered list format
# $sublog::titleurl = variable that the url of interest will be stored in.  Users should use this variable in place
# of any permalink variables they have in their story flavour files if the user has configured the title of posts
# as permalinks.  When a post in the sublog folder is encountered, this plugin will replace the variable with the 
# link of interest; all other posts will be given the normal permalink url of the post.  For the RSS feed to work,
# the bit in between <link> and </link> will have to be replaced in the blosxom template.

# Blosxom Plugin: sublog

# Version: 1
# License: MIT style
# Purpose: To allow weblog-like stuff to be included in a blosxom weblog
# as a $sublog::sublog variable.
#
# Blosxom Plugin: sideblog
# Author: infozo <infozo@infozo.info> http://infozo.info
# Version: 20030708
# License: caveat emptor
# Purpose: to read the first handful of lines from a sideblog file
# containing not-quite-ready-for-prime-time blog material (be it
# uncommented links, simple verbal quips, or unformulated thoughts)
# into a variable made available to the head/foot files.

# --- Configurable variables -----
#
# Where should sublog look for sublog entries?
# Note: if the sublog directory is in your data directory and you do not want sublog posts to
# be shown with the main entries, use the Hide plugin (http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/files/hide.htm)
# to hide sublog entries from blosxom.  That way, you can still leverage blosxom to create archives and
# RSS feeds with a bit of template trickery with the interpolate fancy plugin (http://www.blosxom.com/plugins/interpolate/interpolate_fancy.htm)
# Example: my $sublog_dir = "$blosxom::datadir/sublog";
my $sublog_dir = "$blosxom::datadir/loopylinks";

# What is the name of the sublog directory?
# Example: my $sublog_dir_name = "sublog";
my $sublog_dir_name = "loopylinks";

# how many entries would you like to be displayed in the sublog?
